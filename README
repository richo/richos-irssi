= goodnicks

Goodnicks is a script to help manage your privacy on open, encrypted networks such as psych0tik.

= auto server ng

auto server ng solves the problem of wanting to join a particular channel (ie, #perl, #python) to ask for help but not remembering which chatnet you normally use for that channel.

It gives you another command /join+ which connects you to the right network if you aren't already.
