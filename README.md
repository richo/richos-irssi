= goodnicks

Goodnicks is a script to help manage your privacy on open, encrypted
networks such as psych0tik.

= auto server ng

auto server ng solves the problem of wanting to join a particular channel
(ie, #perl, #python) to ask for help but not remembering which chatnet
you normally use for that channel.

It gives you another command /join+ which connects you to the right
network if you aren't already.

= bnotify

is a fork of fnotify which is a fork of inotify I believe.

I use it to keep track of when I'm being pinged, it's used upstream by
growl and also by tmux.

= timezones

timezone simply adds other timezones to your statusbar. I hacked at it a
little to make it show me the timezone for a friend of mine more legibly
in a narrow terminal

= bitlbee_typing_notice

Is included verbatim as this is a clone of my scripts directory.

Tells people when I'm typing on bitlbee.

= trackbar

Makes it easier to find where you left off.

I added a command to scroll the current window back to the TB, but have
been unable to get hold of the upstream author.

PING @joannac to test it.
